Includes features like autocomplete, multiple themes, command hints etc.\n\n![Sat Naing's Terminal Portfolio](https://satnaing.dev/_ipx/w_2048,q_75/https%3A%2F%2Fres.cloudinary.com%2Fnoezectz%2Fimage%2Fupload%2Fv1654754125%2FSatNaing%2Fterminal-screenshot_gu3kkc.png?url=https%3A%2F%2Fres.cloudinary.com%2Fnoezectz%2Fimage%2Fupload%2Fv1654754125%2FSatNaing%2Fterminal-screenshot_gu3kkc.png&w=2048&q=75)\n\n## Table of contents\n\n## Intro\n\nRecently, I've developed and published my portfolio + a blog. I’m glad I got some good feedback for it. Today, I want to introduce my new terminal-like portfolio website. It is developed using ReactJS, TypeScript. I got this idea from CodePen and YouTube.\n\n## Tech Stack\n\nThis project is a frontend project without any backend codes. The UI/UX part is designed in Figma. For the frontend user-interface, I chose React over pain JavaScript and NextJS. Why?\n\n- Firstly, I want to write declarative code. Managing HTML DOM using JavaScript imperatively is really tedious.\n- Secondly, because it is React!!! It is fast, and reliable.\n- Lastly, I don’t need much of the SEO features, routing and image optimization provided by NextJS.\n\nAnd of course there's TypeScript for type checking.\n\nFor styling, I took a different approach than what I usually do. Instead of choosing Pure CSS, Sass, or Utility CSS Framework like TailwindCSS, I chose the CSS-in-JS way (Styled-Components). Although I’ve known about Styled-Components for some time, I’ve never tried it out. So, the writing style and structures of Styled-Components in this project may not be very organized or very good.\n\nThis project doesn’t need very complex state management. I just use ContextAPI in this project for multiple theming and to avoid prop drilling.\n\nHere’s a quick recap for the tech stack.\n\n- Frontend: [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/ \"React Website\"), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/ \"TypeScript Website\")\n- Styling: [Styled-Components](https://styled-components.com/ \"Styled-Components Website\")\n- UI/UX: [Figma](https://figma.com/ \"Figma Website\")\n- State Management: [ContextAPI](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html \"React ContextAPI\")\n- Deployment: [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/ \"Netlify Website\")\n\n## Features\n\nHere are some features of the project.\n\n### Multiple Themes\n\nUsers can change multiple themes. At the time of writing this post, there are 5 themes; and more themes will probably be added in the future. The selected theme is saved in local storage so that the theme won’t change on page refresh.\n\n![Setting different theme](https://i.ibb.co/fSTCnWB/terminal-portfolio-multiple-themes.gif)\n\n### Command-line Completion\n\nTo look and feel as close to the actual terminal as possible, I put a command-line completion feature which auto fills in partially typed commands by simply pressing ‘Tab’ or ‘Ctrl + i’.\n\n![Demonstrating command-line completion](https://i.ibb.co/CQTGGLF/terminal-autocomplete.gif)\n\n### Previous Commands\n\nUsers can go back to the previous commands or navigate the previously typed commands by pressing Up & Down Arrows.\n\n![Going back to previous commands with UP Arrow](https://i.ibb.co/vD1pSRv/terminal-up-down.gif)\n\n### View/Clear Command History\n\npreviously typed commands can be viewed by typing ‘history’ in the command line. All the command history and terminal screen can be wiped out by typing ‘clear’ or pressing ‘Ctrl + l’.\n\n![Clearing the terminal with 'clear' or 'Ctrl + L' command](https://i.ibb.co/SJBy8Rr/terminal-clear.gif)\n\n## Outro\n\nThis is a really fun project, and one special part of this project is I had to focus on logic rather than user-interface (even though this is kind of a frontend project).\n\n## Project Links\n\n- Website: [https://terminal.satnaing.dev/](https://terminal.satnaing.dev/ \"https://terminal.satnaing.dev/\")\n- Repo: [https://github.com/satnaing/terminal-portfolio](https://github.com/satnaing/terminal-portfolio \"https://github.com/satnaing/terminal-portfolio\")","src/data/blog/insights/terminal-development.md","1a50174c212d30cb",{"html":30,"metadata":31},"\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>This article is originally from my \u003Ca href=\"https://satnaing.dev/blog/posts/how-do-i-develop-my-terminal-portfolio-website-with-react\">blog post\u003C/a>.

I put this article to demonstrate how you can write blog posts/articles using AstroPaper theme.\n\nMy experience about developing my first portfolio website and a blog using NextJS and a headless CMS.\n\n![Building portfolio](https://satnaing.dev/_ipx/w_2048,q_75/https%3A%2F%2Fres.cloudinary.com%2Fnoezectz%2Fimage%2Fupload%2Fv1653050141%2FSatNaing%2Fblog_at_cafe_ei1wf4.jpg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fres.cloudinary.com%2Fnoezectz%2Fimage%2Fupload%2Fv1653050141%2FSatNaing%2Fblog_at_cafe_ei1wf4.jpg&w=2048&q=75)\n\n## Motivation\n\nI've been always thinking about launching my own website with my custom domain name (**satnaing.dev**) since my college student life. But that never happened until this project. I've done several projects and works about web application development but I didn't make an effort to do this.\n\nSo, \"what about blog?\" you may ask. Yeah, blog also has been in my project list for some time. I always wanted to make a blog project using some of the latest technologies. However, I've been busy with my works and other projects so that blog project has never been started.\n\nIn these days, I tend to develop my own projects with the focus in good quality rather than quantity. After the project is done, I usually put a proper readme file in the Github repo. But Github repo readme is only suitable for technical aspects (this is just my thought). I want to write down my experiences and challenges. Thus, I decided to make my own blog. Plus, at this point, I have decent experiences and confidence to develop this project.\n\n## Tech Stack\n\nFor the front-end, I wanted to use [React](https://reactjs.org/ \"React Official Website\"). But React alone is not good enough for SEO; and I did have to consider many factors like routing, image optimization etc. So, I chose [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/ \"NextJS Official Website\") as my main front-end stack. And of course TypeScript for type checking. (It's said that you'll love TypeScript when you're used to it 😉)\n\nFor styling, I use [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/ \"Tailwind CSS Official Website\"). This is because I love developer experience that Tailwind gives and it has a lot of flexibilities compared to other component UI libraries like MUI or React Bootstrap.\n\nAll contents of this project reside within the GitHub repository. All my blog posts (including this one) are written in Markdown file format since I'm very used to with this. But to write Markdown along with its frontmatter effortlessly, I use [Forestry](https://forestry.io/ \"Forestry Official Website\") headless CMS. It is a git-based CMS that can serve Markdown and other contents. Because of this, I can write my contents either using Markdown or wysiwyg editor. Besides, writing frontmatters with this is a breeze.\n\nImages and assets are uploaded and stored in [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/ \"Cloudinary Official Website\"). I connect Cloudinary via Forestry and manage them directly in the dashboard.\n\nIn conclusion, these are the tech stack I've used for this project.\n\n- Front-end: NextJS (TypeScript)\n- Styling: TailwindCSS\n- Animations: GSAP\n- CMS: Forestry Headless CMS\n- Deployment: Vercel\n\n## Features\n\nThe following are certain features of my portfolio and blog\n\n### SEO Friendly\n\nThe entire project is developed with SEO focus in mind. I've used proper meta tags, descriptions and heading alignments. This website is now indexed by Google.\n\n> You can search this website on google by using keywords like 'sat naing dev'\n\n![searching satnaing.dev on google](https://res.cloudinary.com/noezectz/image/upload/v1648231400/SatNaing/satnaing-on-google_asflq6.png \"satnaing.dev is indexed\")\n\nMoreover, this website will be displayed well when shared to social media due to properly used meta tags.\n\n![satnaing.dev card layout when shared to Facebook](https://res.cloudinary.com/noezectz/image/upload/v1653106955/SatNaing/satnaing-dev-share-on-facebook_1_zjoehx.png \"Card layout when shared to Facebook\")\n\n### Dynamic Sitemap\n\nSitemap plays an important part in SEO. Because of this, every single page of this site should be included in sitemap.xml. I made an auto generated sitemap in my website whenever I create a new content or tags or categories.\n\n### Light & Dark Themes\n\nDue to dark theme trend in recent years, many websites include dark theme out of the box nowadays. Certainly, my website also supports light & dark themes.\n\n### Fully Accessible\n\nThis website is fully accessible. You can navigate around by only using keyboard. I put all a11y enhancement best practices like including alt text in all images, no skipping headings, using semantic HTML tags, using aria-attributes properly.\n\n### Search box, Categories & Tags\n\nAll blog contents can be searched by search box. Moreover, contents can be filtered by categories and tags. In this way, blog readers can search and read what they really want.\n\n### Performance and Lighthouse Score\n\nThis website got very good performance and lighthouse score thanks to proper development and best practices. Here's the lighthouse score for this website.\n\n![satnaing.dev Lighthouse score](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/53733092/159957822-7082e459-11e9-4616-8f1e-49d0881f7cbb.png \"satnaing.dev Lighthouse score\")\n\n### Animations\n\nInitially I used [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/ \"Framer Motion\") to add animations and micro interactions for this website. However, when I tried to use some complex animations and parallax effects, I found it inconvenient to integrate with Framer Motion (Maybe I'm not very good at and used to working with it). Hence, I decided to use [GSAP](https://greensock.com/ \"GSAP Animation Library\") for all of my animations. It is one of the most popular animation library and it is capable of doing complex and advanced animations. You can see animations and micro interactions on pretty much every page of this website.\n\n![animations at satnaing.dev](https://res.cloudinary.com/noezectz/image/upload/v1653108324/SatNaing/ezgif.com-gif-maker_2_hehtlm.gif \"satnaing.dev website\")\n\n## Outro\n\nIn conclusion, this project gives me a lot of experience and confidence about developing blog site (SSG). Now, I have gained knowledge of git-based CMS and how it interacts with NextJS. I've also learned about SEO, dynamic sitemap generation and indexing Google procedures.

I put this article to demonstrate how you can write blog posts/articles using AstroPaper theme.\n\nBy default, Tailwind removes all of the default browser styling from paragraphs, headings, lists and more. This ends up being really useful for building application UIs because you spend less time undoing user-agent styles, but when you _really are_ just trying to style some content that came from a rich-text editor in a CMS or a markdown file, it can be surprising and unintuitive.\n\nWe get lots of complaints about it actually, with people regularly asking us things like:\n\n> Why is Tailwind removing the default styles on my `h1` elements? How do I disable this? What do you mean I lose all the other base styles too?\n> We hear you, but we're not convinced that simply disabling our base styles is what you really want. You don't want to have to remove annoying margins every time you use a `p` element in a piece of your dashboard UI. And I doubt you really want your blog posts to use the user-agent styles either — you want them to look _awesome_, not awful.\n\nThe `@tailwindcss/typography` plugin is our attempt to give you what you _actually_ want, without any of the downsides of doing something stupid like disabling our base styles.\n\nIt adds a new `prose` class that you can slap on any block of vanilla HTML content and turn it into a beautiful, well-formatted document:\n\n```html\n\u003Carticle class=\"prose\">\n  \u003Ch1>Garlic bread with cheese: What the science tells us\u003C/h1>\n  \u003Cp>\n    For years parents have espoused the health benefits of eating garlic bread\n    with cheese to their children, with the food earning such an iconic status\n    in our culture that kids will often dress up as warm, cheesy loaf for\n    Halloween.\n  \u003C/p>\n  \u003Cp>\n    But a recent study shows that the celebrated appetizer may be linked to a\n    series of rabies cases springing up around the country.\n  \u003C/p>\n  \u003C!-- ... -->\n\u003C/article>\n```\n\nFor more information about how to use the plugin and the features it includes, [read the documentation](https://github.com/tailwindcss/typography/blob/master/README.md).\n\n---\n\n## What to expect from here on out\n\nWhat follows from here is just a bunch of absolute nonsense I've written to dogfood the plugin itself. It includes every sensible typographic element I could think of, like **bold text**, unordered lists, ordered lists, code blocks, block quotes, _and even italics_.\n\nIt's important to cover all of these use cases for a few reasons:\n\n1. We want everything to look good out of the box.\n2. Really just the first reason, that's the whole point of the plugin.\n3. Here's a third pretend reason though a list with three items looks more realistic than a list with two items.\n\nNow we're going to try out another header style.\n\n### Typography should be easy\n\nSo that's a header for you — with any luck if we've done our job correctly that will look pretty reasonable.\n\nSomething a wise person once told me about typography is:\n\n> Typography is pretty important if you don't want your stuff to look like trash. Make it good then it won't be bad.\n> It's probably important that images look okay here by default as well:\n\n\u003Cfigure>\n  \u003Cimg\n    src=\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1556740758-90de374c12ad?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjEyMDd9&auto=format&fit=crop&w=1000&q=80\"\n    alt=\"\"\n  />\n  \u003Cfigcaption>\n    Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of\n    classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old.\n  \u003C/figcaption>\n\u003C/figure>\n\nNow I'm going to show you an example of an unordered list to make sure that looks good, too:\n\n- So here is the first item in this list.\n- In this example we're keeping the items short.\n- Later, we'll use longer, more complex list items.\n\nAnd that's the end of this section.\n\n## What if we stack headings?\n\n### We should make sure that looks good, too.\n\nSometimes you have headings directly underneath each other. In those cases you often have to undo the top margin on the second heading because it usually looks better for the headings to be closer together than a paragraph followed by a heading should be.\n\n### When a heading comes after a paragraph …\n\nWhen a heading comes after a paragraph, we need a bit more space, like I already mentioned above. Now let's see what a more complex list would look like.\n\n- **I often do this thing where list items have headings.**\n\n  For some reason I think this looks cool which is unfortunate because it's pretty annoying to get the styles right.\n\n  I often have two or three paragraphs in these list items, too, so the hard part is getting the spacing between the paragraphs, list item heading, and separate list items to all make sense. Pretty tough honestly, you could make a strong argument that you just shouldn't write this way.\n\n- **Since this is a list, I need at least two items.**\n\n  I explained what I'm doing already in the previous list item, but a list wouldn't be a list if it only had one item, and we really want this to look realistic. That's why I've added this second list item so I actually have something to look at when writing the styles.\n\n- **It's not a bad idea to add a third item either.**\n\n  I think it probably would've been fine to just use two items but three is definitely not worse, and since I seem to be having no trouble making up arbitrary things to type, I might as well include it.\n\nAfter this sort of list I usually have a closing statement or paragraph, because it kinda looks weird jumping right to a heading.\n\n## Code should look okay by default.\n\nI think most people are going to use [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/) or [Prism](https://prismjs.com/) or something if they want to style their code blocks but it wouldn't hurt to make them look _okay_ out of the box, even with no syntax highlighting.\n\nHere's what a default `tailwind.config.js` file looks like at the time of writing:\n\n```js\nmodule.exports = {\n  purge: [],\n  theme: {\n    extend: {},\n  },\n  variants: {},\n  plugins: [],\n};\n```\n\nHopefully that looks good enough to you.\n\n### What about nested lists?\n\nNested lists basically always look bad which is why editors like Medium don't even let you do it, but I guess since some of you goofballs are going to do it we have to carry the burden of at least making it work.\n\n1. **Nested lists are rarely a good idea.**\n   - You might feel like you are being really \"organized\" or something but you are just creating a gross shape on the screen that is hard to read.\n   - Nested navigation in UIs is a bad idea too, keep things as flat as possible.\n   - Nesting tons of folders in your source code is also not helpful.\n2. **Since we need to have more items, here's another one.**\n   - I'm not sure if we'll bother styling more than two levels deep.\n   - Two is already too much, three is guaranteed to be a bad idea.\n   - If you nest four levels deep you belong in prison.\n3. **Two items isn't really a list, three is good though.**\n   - Again please don't nest lists if you want people to actually read your content.\n   - Nobody wants to look at this.\n   - I'm upset that we even have to bother styling this.\n\nThe most annoying thing about lists in Markdown is that `\u003Cli>` elements aren't given a child `\u003Cp>` tag unless there are multiple paragraphs in the list item. That means I have to worry about styling that annoying situation too.\n\n- **For example, here's another nested list.**\n\n  But this time with a second paragraph.\n\n  - These list items won't have `\u003Cp>` tags\n  - Because they are only one line each\n\n- **But in this second top-level list item, they will.**\n\n  This is especially annoying because of the spacing on this paragraph.\n\n  - As you can see here, because I've added a second line, this list item now has a `\u003Cp>` tag.\n\n    This is the second line I'm talking about by the way.\n\n  - Finally here's another list item so it's more like a list.\n\n- A closing list item, but with no nested list, because why not?\n\nAnd finally a sentence to close off this section.\n\n## There are other elements we need to style\n\nI almost forgot to mention links, like [this link to the Tailwind CSS website](https://tailwindcss.com). We almost made them blue but that's so yesterday, so we went with dark gray, feels edgier.\n\nWe even included table styles, check it out:\n\n| Wrestler                | Origin       | Finisher           |\n| ----------------------- | ------------ | ------------------ |\n| Bret \"The Hitman\" Hart  | Calgary, AB  | Sharpshooter       |\n| Stone Cold Steve Austin | Austin, TX   | Stone Cold Stunner |\n| Randy Savage            | Sarasota, FL | Elbow Drop         |\n| Vader                   | Boulder, CO  | Vader Bomb         |\n| Razor Ramon             | Chuluota, FL | Razor's Edge       |\n\nWe also need to make sure inline code looks good, like if I wanted to talk about `\u003Cspan>` elements or tell you the good news about `@tailwindcss/typography`.\n\n### Sometimes I even use `code` in headings\n\nEven though it's probably a bad idea, and historically I've had a hard time making it look good. This _\"wrap the code blocks in backticks\"_ trick works pretty well though really.\n\nAnother thing I've done in the past is put a `code` tag inside of a link, like if I wanted to tell you about the [`tailwindcss/docs`](https://github.com/tailwindcss/docs) repository. I don't love that there is an underline below the backticks but it is absolutely not worth the madness it would require to avoid it.\n\n#### We haven't used an `h4` yet\n\nBut now we have. Please don't use `h5` or `h6` in your content, Medium only supports two heading levels for a reason, you animals. I honestly considered using a `before` pseudo-element to scream at you if you use an `h5` or `h6`.\n\nWe don't style them at all out of the box because `h4` elements are already so small that they are the same size as the body copy. What are we supposed to do with an `h5`, make it _smaller_ than the body copy? No thanks.\n\n### We still need to think about stacked headings though.\n\n#### Let's make sure we don't screw that up with `h4` elements, either.\n\nPhew, with any luck we have styled the headings above this text and they look pretty good.\n\nLet's add a closing paragraph here so things end with a decently sized block of text. I can't explain why I want things to end that way but I have to assume it's because I think things will look weird or unbalanced if there is a heading too close to the end of the document.\n\nWhat I've written here is probably long enough, but adding this final sentence can't hurt.","src/data/blog/insights/tailwind-typography.md","cad10f5e91a4bc6b",{"html":157,"metadata":158},"\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>This article is from \u003Ca href=\"https://tailwindcss-typography.vercel.app/\">TailwindLabs\u003C/a>.

Wishing you a happy New Year 🎉 and all the best for 2024! We're excited to announce the release of AstroPaper v4, a significant update that introduces a range of new features, improvements, and bug fixes to elevate your blogging experience. A big thank you to all the contributors for their valuable input and efforts in making version 4 possible!\n\n![AstroPaper v4](@/assets/images/AstroPaper-v4.png)\n\n## Table of contents\n\n## Major Changes\n\n### Upgrade to Astro v4 [#202](https://github.com/satnaing/astro-paper/pull/202)\n\nAstroPaper now leverages the power and capabilities of Astro v4. However, it’s a subtle upgrade and won’t break most Astro users.\n\n![Astro v4](https://astro.build/_astro/header-astro-4.YunweN9V_OmV0l.webp)\n\n### Replace `postSlug` with Astro Content `slug` [#197](https://github.com/satnaing/astro-paper/pull/197)\n\nThe `postSlug` in the blog content schema is no longer available in AstroPaper v4. Initially Astro doesn't have a `slug` mechanism and thus we have to figure it out on our own. Since Astro v3, it supports content collection and slug features. Now, we believe it's time to adopt Astro's out-of-the-box `slug` feature.\n\n**_file: src/content/blog/astro-paper-4.md_**\n\n```bash\n---\nauthor: Sat Naing\npubDatetime: 2024-01-01T04:35:33.428Z\ntitle: AstroPaper 4.0\nslug: \"astro-paper-v4\" # if slug is not specified, it will be 'astro-paper-4' (file name).\n# slug: \"\" ❌ cannot be an empty string\n---\n```\n\nThe behavior of the `slug` is slightly different now. In the previous versions of AstroPaper, if the `postSlug` is not specified in a blog post (markdown file), the title of that blog post would be slugified and used as the `slug`. However, in AstroPaper v4, if the `slug` field is not specified, the markdown file name will be used as the `slug`. One thing to keep in mind is that the `slug` field can be omitted, but it cannot be an empty string (slug: \"\" ❌).\n\nIf you're upgrading AstroPaper from v3 to v4, make sure to replace `postSlug` in your `src/content/blog/*.md` files with `slug`.\n\n## New Features\n\n### Add code-snippets for content creation [#206](https://github.com/satnaing/astro-paper/pull/206)\n\nAstroPaper now includes VSCode snippets for new blog posts, eliminating the need for manual copy/pasting of the frontmatter and content structure (table of contents, heading, excerpt, etc.).\n\nRead more about VSCode Snippets [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/userdefinedsnippets#:~:text=In%20Visual%20Studio%20Code%2C%20snippets,Snippet%20in%20the%20Command%20Palette).\n\n\u003Cvideo autoplay muted=\"muted\" controls plays-inline=\"true\" class=\"border border-skin-line\">\n  \u003Csource src=\"https://github.com/satnaing/astro-paper/assets/53733092/136f1903-bade-40a2-b6bb-285a3c726350\" type=\"video/mp4\">\n\u003C/video>\n\n### Add Modified Datetime in Blog Posts [#195](https://github.com/satnaing/astro-paper/pull/195)\n\nKeep readers informed about the latest updates by displaying the modified datetime in blog posts. This not only instills user trust in the freshness of the articles but also contributes to improved SEO for the blog.\n\n![Last Modified Date feature in AstroPaper](https://github.com/satnaing/astro-paper/assets/53733092/cc89585e-148e-444d-9da1-0d496e867175)\n\nYou can add a `modDatetime` to your blog post if you've made modifications. Now, the sorting behavior of the posts is slightly different. All posts are sorted by both `pubDatetime` and `modDatetime`. If a post has both a `pubDatetime` and `modDatetime`, its sorting position will be determined by the `modDatetime`. If not, only `pubDatetime` will be considered to determine the post's sorting order.\n\n### Implement Back-to-Top Button [#188](https://github.com/satnaing/astro-paper/pull/188)\n\nEnhance user navigation on your blog detail post with the newly implemented back-to-top button.\n\n![Back to top button in AstroPaper](https://github.com/satnaing/astro-paper/assets/53733092/79854957-7877-4f19-936e-ad994b772074)\n\n### Add Pagination in Tag Posts [#201](https://github.com/satnaing/astro-paper/pull/201)\n\nImprove content organization and navigation with the addition of pagination in tag posts, making it easier for users to explore related content. This ensures that if a tag has many posts, readers won't be overwhelmed by all the tag-related posts.\n\n\u003Cvideo autoplay loop=\"loop\" muted=\"muted\" plays-inline=\"true\" class=\"border border-skin-line\">\n  \u003Csource src=\"https://github.com/satnaing/astro-paper/assets/53733092/9bad87f5-dcf5-4b79-b67a-d6c7244cd616\" type=\"video/mp4\">\n\u003C/video>\n\n### Dynamically Generate robots.txt [#130](https://github.com/satnaing/astro-paper/pull/130)\n\nAstroPaper v4 now dynamically generates the robots.txt file, giving you more control over search engine indexing and web crawling. Besides, sitemap URL will also be added inside `robot.txt` file.\n\n### Add Docker-Compose File [#174](https://github.com/satnaing/astro-paper/pull/174)\n\nManaging your AstroPaper environment is now easier than ever with the addition of a Docker-Compose file, simplifying deployment and configuration.\n\n## Refactoring & Bug Fixes\n\n### Replace Slugified Title with Unslugified Tag Name [#198](https://github.com/satnaing/astro-paper/pull/198)\n\nTo improve clarity, user experience and SEO, titles (`Tag: some-tag`) in tag page are no longer slugified (`Tag: Some Tag`).\n\n![Unslugified Tag Names](https://github.com/satnaing/astro-paper/assets/53733092/2fe90d6e-ec52-467b-9c44-95009b3ae0b7)\n\n### Implement 100svh for Min-Height ([79d569d](https://github.com/satnaing/astro-paper/commit/79d569d053036f2113519f41b0d257523d035b76))\n\nWe've updated the min-height on the body to use 100svh, offering a better UX for mobile users.\n\n### Update Site URL as Single Source of Truth [#143](https://github.com/satnaing/astro-paper/pull/143)\n\nThe site URL is now a single source of truth, streamlining configuration and avoiding inconsistencies. Read more at this [PR](https://github.com/satnaing/astro-paper/pull/143) and its related issue(s).\n\n### Solve Invisible Text Code Block Issue in Light Mode [#163](https://github.com/satnaing/astro-paper/pull/163)\n\nWe've fixed the invisible text code block issue in light mode.\n\n### Decode Unicode Tag Characters in Breadcrumb [#175](https://github.com/satnaing/astro-paper/pull/175)\n\nThe last part of Tag in the breadcrumb is now decoded, making non-English Unicode characters display better.\n\n### Update LOCALE Config to Cover Overall Locales ([cd02b04](https://github.com/satnaing/astro-paper/commit/cd02b047d2b5e3b4a2940c0ff30568cdebcec0b8))\n\nThe LOCALE configuration has been updated to cover a broader range of locales, catering to a more diverse audience.\n\n## Outtro\n\nWe believe these updates will significantly elevate your AstroPaper experience. Thank you to everyone who contributed, solved issues, and gave stars to AstroPaper. We look forward to seeing the amazing content you create with AstroPaper v4!\n\nHappy Blogging!\n\n[Sat Naing](https://satnaing.dev) \u003Cbr/>\nCreator of AstroPaper","src/data/blog/insights/astro-paper-4.md",[215,216],"@/assets/images/AstroPaper-v4.png","../../../assets/images/AstroPaper-v4.png","50501d95070a77d3",{"html":219,"metadata":220},"\u003Cp>Hello everyone!

These files include\n\n- `/src/config.ts` (didn't touch in v3)\n- `/src/styles/base.css` (minor changes in v3; mentioned below)\n- `/src/assets/` (didn't touch in v3)\n- `/public/assets/` (didn't touch in v3)\n- `/content/blog/` (it's your blog content directory 🤷🏻‍♂️)\n- Any other customizations you've made.\n\n```css\n/* file: /src/styles/base.css */\n@layer base {\n  /* Other Codes */\n  ::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb:hover {\n    @apply bg-skin-card-muted;\n  }\n\n  /* Old code\n  code {\n    white-space: pre;\n    overflow: scroll;\n  } \n  */\n\n  /* New code */\n  code,\n  blockquote {\n    word-wrap: break-word;\n  }\n  pre > code {\n    white-space: pre;\n  }\n}\n\n@layer components {\n  /* other codes */\n}\n```\n\n**_Step 1: Replace everything else with AstroPaper v3_**\n\nIn this step, replace everything\\_ except above files/directories (plus your customized files/directories)\\_ with AstroPaper v3.\n\n**_Step 3: Schema Updates_**\n\nKeep in mind that `/src/content/_schemas.ts` has been replaced with `/src/content/config.ts`.\n\nBesides, there is no longer `BlogFrontmatter` type exported from `/src/content/config.ts`.\n\nTherefore, all the `BlogFrontmatter` type inside files need to be updated with `CollectionEntry\u003C\"blog\">[\"data\"]`.\n\nFor example: `src/components/Card.tsx`\n\n```ts\n// AstroPaper v2\nimport type { BlogFrontmatter } from \"@content/_schemas\";\n\nexport interface Props {\n  href?: string;\n  frontmatter: BlogFrontmatter;\n  secHeading?: boolean;\n}\n```\n\n```ts\n// AstroPaper v3\nimport type { CollectionEntry } from \"astro:content\";\n\nexport interface Props {\n  href?: string;\n  frontmatter: CollectionEntry\u003C\"blog\">[\"data\"];\n  secHeading?: boolean;\n}\n```\n\n## Option 2: Upgrade using Git\n\nThis approach is not recommended for most users. You should do the \"Option 1\" if you can. Only do this if you know how to resolve merge conflicts and you know what you're doing.\n\nActually, I've already written a blog post for this case and you can check out [here](https://astro-paper.pages.dev/posts/how-to-update-dependencies/#updating-astropaper-using-git).\n\n## Outro\n\nReady to explore the exciting new features and improvements in AstroPaper v3?

The `tailwind.config.js` file has been removed, and now all the configuration is located within the `src/styles/global.css` file. Typography-related styles have been extracted and moved to `src/styles/typography.css`.\n\nDue to the new behavior in TailwindCSS v4, styles inside `\u003Cstyle>` blocks within components have been removed and replaced with inline Tailwind classes.\n\nAdditionally, the color palette across the UI has been updated. The new palette now consists of only five colors:\n\n```css\n:root,\nhtml[data-theme=\"light\"] {\n  --background: #fdfdfd;\n  --foreground: #282728;\n  --accent: #006cac;\n  --muted: #e6e6e6;\n  --border: #ece9e9;\n}\n\nhtml[data-theme=\"dark\"] {\n  --background: #212737;\n  --foreground: #eaedf3;\n  --accent: #ff6b01;\n  --muted: #343f60bf;\n  --border: #ab4b08;\n}\n```\n\n### Remove React + Fuse.js in favor of Pagefind search\n\nIn previous versions, React.js and Fuse.js were used for search functionality and OG image generation. In AstroPaper v5, React.js has been removed and replaced with [Pagefind](https://pagefind.app/), a static site search tool.\n\nThe search experience is almost identical to previous versions, but now all contents, not just titles and descriptions, are indexed and searchable, thanks to Pagefind.\n\nThe idea of using Pagefind in dev mode was inspired by [this blog post](https://chrispennington.blog/blog/pagefind-static-search-for-astro-sites/).\n\n### Updated import alias\n\nThe import alias has been updated from `@directory` to `@/directory`, which means you now have to import like this:\n\n```astro\n---\nimport { slugifyStr } from \"@/utils/slugify\";\nimport IconHash from \"@/assets/icons/IconHash.svg\";\n---\n```\n\n### Move to `pnpm`\n\nAstroPaper has switched from `npm` to `pnpm`, which offers faster and more efficient package management.\n\n### Replace icons/svg with Astro's Svg Component\n\nAstroPaper v5 replaces inline SVGs with Astro’s experimental [SVG Component](https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/experimental-flags/svg/). This update reduces the need for predefined SVG code in the `socialIcons` object, making the codebase cleaner and more maintainable.\n\n### Separate Constants and Config\n\nThe project structure has been reorganized. The `src/config.ts` file now only contains the `SITE` object, which holds the main configuration for the project. All constants, such as `LOCALE`, `SOCIALS`, and `SHARE_LINKS`, have been moved to the `src/constants.ts` file.\n\n## Other notable changes\n\n- The blog posts directory has been updated from `src/content/blog/` to `src/data/blog/`.\n- Conllection definitions file (`src/content/config.ts`) is now replaced with `src/content.config.ts`.\n- Various dependencies have been upgraded for improved performance and security.\n- Removed `IBM Plex Mono` font and switched to the default system mono font.\n- The `Go back` button logic has been updated. Now, instead of triggering the browser's history API, AstroPaper v5 uses the browser session to temporarily store the back URL. If no back URL exists in the session, it will redirect to the homepage.\n- There are some minor styles and layout changes as well.\n\n## Outtro\n\nAstroPaper v5 brings many changes, but the core experience remains the same. Enjoy a smoother, more efficient blogging platform while keeping the clean and minimal design that AstroPaper is known for!\n\nFeel free to explore the changes and share your thoughts. As always, thank you for your support!\n\nIf you enjoy this theme, please consider starring the repo. You can also support me via GitHub Sponsors or you can buy me a coffee if you'd like.

Blog schema is defined inside the `src/content/_schemas.ts` file.\n\n### New Home for Blog contents\n\nAll the blog posts were moved from `src/contents` to `src/content/blog` directory.\n\n### New Fetch API\n\nContents are now fetched with `getCollection` function. No relative path to the content needs to be specified anymore.\n\n```ts\n// old content fetching method\n- const postImportResult = import.meta.glob\u003CMarkdownInstance\u003CFrontmatter>>(\n  \"../contents/**/**/*.md\",);\n\n// new content fetching method\n+ const postImportResult = await getCollection(\"blog\");\n```\n\n### Modified Search Logic for better Search Result\n\nIn the older version of AstroPaper, when someone search some article, the search criteria keys that will be searched are `title`, `description` and `headings` (heading means all the headings h1 ~ h6 of the blog post). In AstroPaper v2, only `title` and `description` will be searched as the user types.\n\n### Renamed Frontmatter Properties\n\nThe following frontmatter properties are renamed.\n\n| Old Names | New Names   |\n| --------- | ----------- |\n| datetime  | pubDatetime |\n| slug      | postSlug    |\n\n### Default Tag for blog post\n\nIf a blog post doesn't have any tag (in other words, frontmatter property `tags` is not specified), the default tag `others` will be used for that blog post. But you can set the default tag in the `/src/content/_schemas.ts` file.\n\n```ts\n// src/contents/_schemas.ts\nexport const blogSchema = z.object({\n  // ---\n  // replace \"others\" with whatever you want\n  tags: z.array(z.string()).default([\"others\"]),\n  ogImage: z.string().optional(),\n  description: z.string(),\n});\n```\n\n### New Predefined Dark Color Scheme\n\nAstroPaper v2 has a new dark color scheme (high contrast & low contrast) which is based on Astro's dark logo. Check out [this link](https://astro-paper.pages.dev/posts/predefined-color-schemes#astro-dark) for more info.\n\n![New Predefined Dark Color Scheme](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/53733092/215680520-59427bb0-f4cb-48c0-bccc-f182a428d72d.svg)\n\n### Automatic Class Sorting\n\nAstroPaper 2.0 includes automatic class sorting with [TailwindCSS Prettier plugin](https://tailwindcss.com/blog/automatic-class-sorting-with-prettier)\n\n### Updated Docs & README\n\nAll the [#docs](https://astro-paper.pages.dev/tags/docs/) blog posts and [README](https://github.com/satnaing/astro-paper#readme) are updated for this AstroPaper v2.\n\n## Bug Fixes\n\n- fix broken tags in the Blog Post page\n- in a tag page, the last part of the breadcrumb is now updated to lower-case for consistency\n- exclude draft posts in a tag page\n- fix 'onChange value not updating issue' after a page reload","src/data/blog/insights/astro-paper-2.md",[402],"c33285ceb5aea3b2",{"html":425,"metadata":426},"\u003Cp>Astro 2.0 has been released with some cool features, breaking changes, DX improvements, better error overlay and so on.
